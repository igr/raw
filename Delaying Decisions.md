# Delaying Decisions
To delay a decision is **wrong**. We need the _feedback_ as soon as possible.
---- 
Delaying decisions makes sense only in the context of the _focus_. We can not and should not make all the decisions at once. The focus should be on the most valuable decisions first.
This is not delaying decisions, but rescheduling.
