# Stop life-couching software engineering

Do you know what is one the most valuable traits in _prison_? Good relationships and good communication. 

Now replace word "prison" with "software development."

No, the point here is not that software development is any sort of prison (totally different topic.)

We should **stop** mixing engineering with every damn thing we think of. Yes, whenever you have people involved, their relationships matter. But engineering must be beyond that. It must be equally precise and efficient with or without individualities.
