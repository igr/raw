# Incremental development requires planning ahead

It is assumed that incremental development (under the "agile" umbrella) requires no significant planning ahead other than for the next sprint.

This is wrong. Planning only the next sprint removes the focus from the project itself. This approach ends with many refactoring and changes to the existing code, rendering previous work obsolete.

Do the "dry-run" development with all relevant parties (client-dev tech leads) before the actual development starts. Go over functionalities and build a project mockup. Find boundaries, sequences, and behaviours. Outline the complete project first.

It's not the waterfall. It's about _understanding_. As more you understand in front, the better.
