# Changes

Many methodologies preach that changes are welcomed and an integral part of software development. Changes are related to incremental development, rapid development, and competitive environments.

In software development, change is expected. It is expected that the process accommodates changes. "Let's build now and change later" attitude is considered healthy.

Forgotten is that every change is _expensive_.

Accommodating changes in methodologies is all about reducing the change in cost and time.

What is hurt? _Quality_ (of the product and development process.)

Changes should not be taken lightly.
