# Coding is not Art

Developers are delusional: they mix fine-crafted code with art.

The Code is not Art.

Art can exist without purpose. Art can be rough. Art can be non-functional. Art can be minimalistic.

Not the code.

Fine crafting is a skill. You can be skilled in coding, writing, painting, and singing... but you are still not an engineer or artist.
