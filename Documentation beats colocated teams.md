# Documentation beats colocated teams

There is an increasing belief that colocation is a critical success factor for an effective team.

If true, the working process and documentation are not in place.

An effective team _understands_ the effects of colocation and takes it into the day-to-day work. In short, instead of talking out loud, write it down. [[Writing beats talking]], but requires skill and focus.

The only undeniable collocation feature is an opportunity for people to bond.
